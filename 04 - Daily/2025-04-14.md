## What I Did Today (summary)

Created a local user called `scpuser` at the ZimaBoard server.

This user will be used for connections from my Debian 12 for updating the docs at the development phase.

Two SSH keys have been created:

1. Used SCP the `.tar.gz` file.
2. Used to trigger the `extract_and_build.sh` script to update the local docs.



## What I Did Today (techical)

Used the command `useradd -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin scpuser` to create a local user. Then realized it needs to have an interactive shell, so I updated it to `/bin/bash` using `chsh -s /bin/bash scpuser`.

Created two SSH keys with the names `scpuser_key` and `scpusertrigger_key` by using the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/<key_name>`.

Added the following entries into `/home/scpuser/.ssh/authorized_keys`, using the content of the files mentioned:

```
command="scp -t /home/scpuser/uploads",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty <scpuser_key.pub>

command="/mnt/Storage1/DATA/AppData/docs/mkdocs_dev/extract_and_build.sh \"$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\"",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty <scpusertrigger_key.pub>
```

The directory `/home/scpuser/uploads` is linked to `/mnt/Storage1/uploads` to use the bigger hard-drive, to link it I used the command `ln -s /mnt/Storage1/uploads /home/scpuser/uploads`.

After multiple manual commands to test things out, I found out that `scp` was using the `sftp` protocol instead of `scp`, so the `-O` needed to be added. The resulting command to transfer files using the key created before we use the following command `scp -O -i ~/.ssh/scpuser_key <local_file> scpuser@10.0.0.1:~/uploads`.

Then, to be able to run the script at the server by specifying the file to use, we can use the command `ssh -i /home/oriol/.ssh/scpusertrigger_key scpuser@10.0.0.1 "/mnt/Storage1/uploads/<local_file>"`.

So I've converted both commands into a ZSH function to use them easier:

```zsh
function transfer-docs(){
  scp -O -i ~/.ssh/scpuser_key $1 scpuser@10.0.0.1:~/uploads &&  ssh -i ~/.ssh/scpusertrigger_key scpuser@10.0.0.1 "/mnt/Storage1/uploads/$1" 
}
```
