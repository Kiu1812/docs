# Discovering Email Addresses

---

A list of useful resources to find emails:


- [hunter.io](https://hunter.io/): We type the company name and we see emails related to that company.
- [phonebook.cz](https://phonebook.cz/): With this resource we can search for domains and URLs as well as email addresses.
- [voilanorbert.com](https://www.voilanorbert.com/): We have a limited amount but it's quite the same of *hunter.io*.
- [Clearbit Connect](https://clearbit.com/resources/tools/connect): In a web extension type, we have this resource, we can filter by role and seniority.
- [EmailHippo](https://tools.emailhippo.com/): With this website we can verify if an email address exists or not.
- [Email Checker](https://email-checker.net/): Another website to test if an email address is valid or not.
