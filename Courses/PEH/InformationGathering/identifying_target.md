# Identifying Our Target

---

Before we begin doing our reconnaissance we have to establish a client to attack. This course uses a target from [bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/).

In bug bounty websites like these where we select a target it's important to look at the scope, those are the targets and things we are allowed to search in, so we need to make sure we stay inside the scope.
