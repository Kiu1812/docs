# Passive Reconnaissance Overview

---

There are different types of passive reconnaissance:

- Physical / Social:

This means to actually go to the building and maybe doing a **physical engagement**, or the **social engineering** aspect doing a phishing assessment or merging those to to try to get into the private areas.

We have **location information**, we can use satellite images, often will go on site and do drone reconnaissance and what we are searching is things like, building layout, badge readers, break areas, security people, fencing, areas with doors open, etc....

In the other hand we can search for **information about the job**, employees, it's name, title, phone number, manager. We can also search for pictures like badge photos, desk photos, computer photos.


- Web / Host:

The first thing we should do is **target validation**, there are situations where a client will give you an IP address or a website and the client mistypes some character and you're attacking another website you shouldn't.

Another things to do is **search for subdomains**, we can use google, nmap, sublist3r, etc....

There's also **fingerprinting**, we need to know what's running on a website or a host, what kind of services are running, is a web server, which one, maybe IIS or Apache, what version of it, what ports are running. But we are still on the passive side, we are not gonna touch and scan the machines, maybe just connect to the website and look through there but without actually scanning it.

Lastly, we need to search for **data breaches**, we are talking about breached incidents from the past that could have leaked data, we can try to utilize those to get access, or at least the usernames
