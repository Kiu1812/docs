# Identify Technologies

---

From the security perspective, it's fundamental to know the technologies and tools that a web page is using. The identification of these technologies allows the experts to evaluate the potential risks of a website, identify vulnerabilities and design effective strategies to protect the information stored in the server.

There are plenty of tools that allow to identify the technologies used in a website. Some of the most popular are [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb), [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) and [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/).
This tools scan the website and provide us detailed information about the technologies used, programming languages, web server, content management systems and more.


[WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) identifies websites. Its goal is to answer the question, "What is that Website?". WhatWeb recognises web technologies including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. WhatWeb has over 1800 plugins, each to recognise something different. WhatWeb also identifies version numbers, email addresses, account IDs, web framework modules, SQL errors, and more.

[Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) allows us to instantly reveal the technology stack of any website, such as CMS, ecommerce platform or payment processor, as well as company and contact details.

[BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) allos us to build a report based on a technology being used on over 370 million active domains from our database of 108,426+ technologies.
