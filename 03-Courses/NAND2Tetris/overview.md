# NAND2Tetris


In this project-centered course you will build a modern computer system, from the ground up. We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.

We're going to divide this huge enterprise into two separate courses. In the first course we're going to build the hardware of the computer. And in the second course that will be offered we're going to do complete the picture and build the software hierarchy that sits on top of the computer that you will build in the first course.

The first course has the following content, divided into different projects. They all work together into building the `Hack` computer.
1. Boolean Logic
2. Boolean Arithmetic
3. Memory
4. Machine Language
5. Computer Architecture
6. Assembler Roadmap
