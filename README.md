# 🧠 Personal Knowledge Base

Welcome to my knowledge base — a structured log of everything I'm learning and exploring, mostly in cybersecurity, but also including topics like programming and artificial intelligence.

This vault is built with a focus on hands-on learning, synthesis, and organization of both theory and practice. It includes notes from courses, labs, research, documentation, and self-driven projects.

> 🚧 Under construction: many sections are incomplete or pending review.
